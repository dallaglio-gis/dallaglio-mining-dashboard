# Release Notes — Mining Dashboard (2025-08-25)

These notes document the recent changes that fixed non-functional downloads and improved reliability across the dashboard.

## Summary
- Resolved download issues by standardizing all export code paths in `combined_app.py`.
- Ensured every DataFrame is sanitized prior to UI display or download.
- All CSV exports now use UTF-8 encoded bytes to avoid serialization issues.
- Added unique Streamlit keys to every download button to prevent key collisions.
- Always render the bulk ZIP download button so exports are never gated by extra clicks.
- Added byte-size captions next to download buttons for quick verification that data is being produced.
- Introduced optional debugging aids for column dtypes and sample values.

## Files Touched
- `combined_app.py`

## Key Changes

- Mining Data Processor (`display_mining_results()` in `combined_app.py`)
  - Added per‑sheet CSV download buttons with unique keys: `mp_dl_{sheet}`.
  - Each per‑sheet CSV now shows a file size caption for quick validation.
  - Benches average grades export added key `mp_dl_benches_avg` and size caption.
  - All per‑sheet exports use sanitized DataFrames and `to_csv_bytes()` (UTF‑8) before download.

- Bulk ZIP Export (`create_bulk_download()` in `combined_app.py`)
  - Button is always rendered when results exist (no extra click required).
  - Writes only sanitized CSVs into an in‑memory ZIP.
  - Uses a single download button with key `mp_zip_download` and a ZIP size caption.

- Production Dashboard (`run_production_dashboard_page()` in `combined_app.py`)
  - Filtered data export now uses `to_csv_bytes()` and unique key `pd_download_filtered`.
  - Shows file size caption after generating the CSV bytes.

- Daily Report Update (`run_daily_report_update_page()` in `combined_app.py`)
  - After `udr.main()` completes, the download button now uses key `dr_download`.
  - Shows file size caption for the generated workbook bytes.

- Debugging Aids (Mining Data Processor)
  - Sidebar toggle: "Show Debug Column Types" (session key `mp_show_dtypes`).
  - Debug expander prints dtypes and samples of object columns to quickly detect problematic fields.

- Visualization & Validation Helpers
  - Implemented `display_visualizations(df, sheet_type)` (lightweight plots on sanitized data).
  - Implemented `display_validation_results(validation)` to render validation summaries safely.

## Why This Fix Works
- Sanitizing before display/download prevents Arrow/serialization errors from mixed types and rogue byte strings.
- Encoding CSVs to UTF‑8 bytes aligns with Streamlit’s expectations for `st.download_button`.
- Unique keys remove widget key collisions that can disable or hide buttons.
- Always showing the bulk ZIP button avoids gating the action behind state that may not update when processing completes.
- Size captions verify non‑empty bytes are produced, making it obvious if a data path yields no output.

## Compatibility & Dependencies
- `requirements.txt` (unchanged):
  - streamlit==1.36.0
  - pandas==2.2.2
  - numpy==1.26.4
  - openpyxl==3.1.5
  - plotly==5.22.0
- Note: CSV downloads do not require `pyarrow`. If desired, we can pin `pyarrow` for consistent DataFrame IO elsewhere.

## How to Run
```bash
streamlit run combined_app.py
```

## Known Limitations / Next Steps
- Add automated tests for serialization and export paths.
- Confirm dependency environment consistency across machines (optional `pyarrow` pin).
- Continue validating with large/edge‑case datasets.
