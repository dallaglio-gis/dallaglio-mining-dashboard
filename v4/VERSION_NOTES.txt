# Version Notes - CEO Daily Report Automation

## 2025-07-01
### Major Enhancements
- Script now updates existing daily sheets if source data changes, not just adding new ones.
- Month-To-Date (MTD) values are recalculated for each day, using cumulative actuals up to that day (not static values).
- Budget MTD values are also calculated cumulatively for each day, using daily budget values from the source file (not static values).
- Both MTD and Budget MTD use weighted average for grade calculations.
- Handles backdating: if previous days' data is updated, all affected subsequent days' MTD and Budget MTD are recalculated.
- Smarter change detection: sheets are only updated if there is a real change in daily, MTD, or Budget MTD values.
- All enhancements are backward compatible with previous versions of the script.

### Configuration
- Budget value row numbers are now configurable in the script (see extract_daily_data_for_month).
- No changes to input/output file naming conventions.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues where MTD and Budget MTD could be out of sync if data changed after initial reporting.

### Usage
- See updated README_run_instructions.txt for usage details.
