# Combined Mining Dashboard (Streamlit)

A Streamlit app that consolidates three tools into a single dashboard:

- Mining Data Processor — validates and summarizes daily mining report data.
- Production Dashboard — interactive charts/tables of production KPIs.
- Daily Report Update — generates/updates a Geology Work Plan workbook from a monthly Daily Report.
- Monthly Stope Performance — updates the Monthly Stope Performance workbook by applying 3-month rolling forecasts, actuals, and PNM/MNP updates, and returns an updated workbook for download.

Main app entrypoint: `combined_app.py`.

## Features
- First-command page config safe from import-time conflicts.
- Robust module path handling for `v1.1.4/` and `v4/` modules.
- Uses an included template workbook in `v4/` (e.g. `Geology Daily Work Plan August2025.xlsx`).
- Works with uploaded Excel files and returns downloadable results.

- Monthly Stope Performance page: in-memory Excel updates, robust parsing/ID normalization, and a timestamped download with file-size caption.

## What's new
- Monthly Stope Performance page integrated into the combined app navigation.
- MSP helper parsing and workbook update functions integrated into `combined_app.py`.
- Consistent sanitization and download behavior (timestamped filenames, file-size captions).
- Dependencies pinned including `pyarrow==15.0.2` for Arrow stability.
- Documentation updates and clearer usage guidance.

```

## Local setup
Requirements: Python 3.10–3.11 recommended.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run combined_app.py
```

## Monthly Stope Performance usage
1. Open the app and select "Monthly Stope Performance" in the sidebar Navigation.
2. Upload the MSP workbook (.xlsx) to be updated.
3. Optionally upload supporting inputs (e.g., 3‑month rolling forecasts, actual physicals, daily report, underground breaking plan, tramming detail reports).
4. Click the process/update action to apply updates to the workbook.
5. Download the updated Excel; the filename includes a timestamp and a file-size caption is shown.

## Streamlit Community Cloud deployment
1. Push this folder to a public GitHub repository (see name ideas below).
2. Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud and create a new app.
3. Point to your repo/branch.
4. Set Main file path to `combined_app.py`.
5. Deploy.

Notes:
- The app reads the template from `v4/` by filename pattern `Geology Daily Work Plan*.xlsx`. Make sure the template file is committed.
- File writes occur in a temporary directory and downloads are served to the user (Cloud-compatible).
- If your Excel files are very large (>100 MB), consider Git LFS.

## Troubleshooting
- Page config errors: Ensure `st.set_page_config()` is the first Streamlit command in `combined_app.py` (already configured).
- Template not found: Confirm a file matching `Geology Daily Work Plan*.xlsx` exists in `v4/`.
- Import errors: The app auto-adds `v1.1.4/` and `v4/` to `sys.path`. Keep the directories alongside `combined_app.py`.

- Arrow serialization errors: ensure your environment uses pinned `pyarrow==15.0.2` (already in `requirements.txt`); re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and restart. Ensure you're uploading standard Excel files.
- MSP workbook schema: confirm sheets `SUMMARY` and `Stopes PNM & MNP` exist and are not protected; the page updates these sheets in-place.
